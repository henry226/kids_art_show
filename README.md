# MET-CS673-Group1-TermProject
## Introduction:
Kids love arts, they‘re born naturally creators. Art helps kids to express their views and their emotions on the surrounding world.
Our web-based software platform provides parents and teachers a repository to store and share their little ones' art-related creations.
The user interface will be designed as part of the project. With an account registered on our platform, users can upload, download, view and share kids’ artwork between families and friends.
In addition, we provide progress tracking so that users(parents) can easily see their kids' growth.
